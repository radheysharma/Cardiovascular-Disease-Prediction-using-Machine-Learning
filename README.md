# Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning
This a project aimed at leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases in individuals based on various health parameters (such as age, gender, height, weight) and risk factors (such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholestrol, glucose, smoking/drinking habits, activity). This project seeks to develop accurate predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. Through the fusion of data science and healthcare, this endeavor aims to contribute to preventive medicine, potentially saving lives and improving overall public health outcomes.
